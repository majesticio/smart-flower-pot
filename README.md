# Smart Flower Pot

My smart pot is made with a sleek laser etched acrylic case. Water is stored below in a tower type design. There is an OLED display that shows the time, air quality, dust level, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture as well. The plant is watered whenever the soil is dry. You can also see the sensor output and control the output on Adafruit's online dashboard.
